## 🐼 What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with structured data.  
It provides fast, powerful, and flexible data structures for data cleaning, exploration, and transformation.

## ✅ Why Use Pandas?

- Efficiently handles large datasets.
- Cleans and transforms messy data.
- Performs filtering, sorting, and aggregation easily.
- Supports multiple formats: CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, etc.
- Integrates well with visualization and machine learning libraries.
